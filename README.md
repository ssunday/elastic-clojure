# elastic-clojure

Interactive elastic search using lojure because why not.

## Running It

Have an elasticsearch instance running at http://127.0.0.1:9200.

Use command:

`lein run`

Go to webbrowser of choice and go to port 4000 on localhost.

Type in stuff to search. Currently only supports full-text searching. More to come.

## Running the Tests

There are none because I am lazy so don't worry about it.
